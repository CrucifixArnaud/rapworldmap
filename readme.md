Rap World Map - An Atlas of World Rap

## About

### Data Presented

This atlas don't aim to be exaustif. It's impossible to give a complete panel of what exists. In concequence we have probably missed a lot of artists, don't hesitate to suggest a new adition.

### Localisation precision

We have decide to locate each artists where they grow up or where they spent a signifiant part of their life instead of their born place (wich could be sometime irrelevant). It could occured in some strong opinionated decision.

The exact localisation of some artists is quite easy to found (we know in wich house, street they grew up, etc), but for the other one it's not the case. We try to locate their childhood neighborhood, where they went to school, and display them there. If the only know information is the city, we choose a random set of coordinates in this area.

If you think we have made a major mistake about an artist, don't hesitate to contact us with your remarks, we will adapt the database based on your input.
