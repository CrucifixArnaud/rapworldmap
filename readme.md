Display an atlas of rap artists based on their "neighborhood".

## About

Project create by Arnaud Crucifix (http://crucifixarnaud.com).

### Aim of the project

Maybe more than any other genre of music, Rap and Hiphop is deeply anchor to the place where the artists procuded it. Since rappers start to describe their everyday life condition, they describe their vision of their neighborhood. A lot of french rapper are famous for shouting their area code in their song, representing their neighborhood, using their song as a lever to reclaim a bit of pride around area generaly considered poor and abandoned by the state.

Even if the democratisation of the internet access reduce concept of the border in music, originaly it exists various "subgenre" of rap based on their regions, because of similarity in the theme, type of sounds or flow, or simply accent of the artist. From the oldschool New York boombap to the californian GFunk, passing by the devilish Memphis sound or the original Atlanta trap. Representing major artists in their region can help visualised these "natural subdivision".

Map can tell story. Looking at the map of Paris rap, it's easy to noticed that the vast majority of artists come from the outskirt of the city, put in parralele with the history of Paris and you can deduce a lot about history of imigrations & urbanisation of the city.

### Data Presented

This atlas don't aim to be exaustif. There is a incredible amount of rap artists, each day new one appears and releases new songs, mixtapes and projects. It's impossible to give a complete panel of what exists. In concequence we have probably missed a lot of artists, don't hesitate to suggest a new adition.

### Localisation precision

We have decide to locate each artist where they grow up or where they spent a signifiant part of their life that influence their musique instead of their born place (wich could be sometime irrelevant). It could occured in some strong opinionated decision. For example:

2 Pac have grow up en attempt school in Harlem until is 18 years old. Even if he only start producing song and album after is move to California, and that he is a major representante of the westcoast school. I considred that the vast majority of is education, and what could possibly influence him as a human being, occured in Harlem (New York). In concequence 2 Pac is represented in Harlem instead of California.

The precise localisation of certain artists is quite easy (we know in wich house, street they grew up, etc), but for a majority of them it's don't easy to define a correct localisation. I generaly try to locate the neighborhood where they grew up, where they goes to school, and display them there. If I don't found any other information than the city, I choose a random set of coordinates in this area.

If you concider I have made a major mistake about an artist, don't hesitate to contact me with your remarks, I will adapt the database based on your input.
